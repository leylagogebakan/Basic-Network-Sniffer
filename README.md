# Basic-Network-Sniffer
The "Basic Network Sniffer" project is a simple yet informative endeavor in Python, utilizing the scapy library to capture and analyze network traffic. This project serves as an educational tool to deepen understanding of data flow within a network and the structure of network packets. By employing packet sniffing techniques, the sniffer extracts crucial information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol types (TCP, UDP, ICMP), and additional details for TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets. Users can gain insights into the dynamics of their network and enhance their comprehension of the underlying communication protocols. It's important to note that deploying network sniffers may require administrative privileges and should be conducted with consideration of legal and ethical implications.
